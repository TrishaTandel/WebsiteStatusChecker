In some cases, we have the largest of domains and sub domains which need to be tested for security 
f
 laws. the first step is to check the activeness in the domains on the internet. A recce tool is an 
automated tool that is developed in the Python language which has the potential to scan 11k 
domains in just 3 minutes and return their status. Recce tool also supports saving the results in text 
formatted tile. This tool is available on GitHub for free. It's open-source so anyone can contribute to 
it. 
Recce refers to several different tools, so website status checker information depends on which tool 
is being referenced. The two most relevant are a website/domain status checker for security testing 
and a data validation tool for data teams.  
Recce (unstabl3/recce)—Website status checker 
This is an open-source Python tool for security professionals and ethical hackers.  
• Primary function: Scans domains and subdomains from a list to check if they are "alive" or 
active on the internet. 
• Purpose: Primarily used for the initial reconnaissance (or "recce") phase of penetration 
testing to quickly identify a large number of active domains that need further testing. 
• Key features: 
o High performance: Can scan thousands of domains in minutes. 
o Python-based: Developed in Python, making it accessible for users familiar with 
scripting. 
o List processing: Takes a list of domains from a text file (domains.txt). 
o Result saving: Saves the output of active domains to a text file (results.txt). 
Website status check process: 
1.The tool reads a list of domains from a provided text file. 
2.It sends automated requests to each domain to determine its live status. 
3.The results are then compiled and displayed.
